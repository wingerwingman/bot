## 🚀 ACTIVE RESEARCH & EXPERIMENTAL

### 1. Machine Learning Signal Confirmation
**Status:** EXPERIMENTAL (Refining accuracy)
**Description:** Uses Random Forest Classifier to predict trade outcomes based on indicators.
**Current Focus:** Optimizing feature selection to reduce noise.

### 2. Monte Carlo Strategy Stress Testing
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Description:** Run thousands of backtest variations with randomized slippage/delays to find the strategy's true "Edge".

### 3. Sentiment Analysis Integration
**Status:** RESEARCHING
**Description:** Integrate crypto Twitter or News API to filter trades against extreme negative sentiment.

### 4. Self-Healing Order Resolution
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Description:** If a Binance order hangs or is partially filled due to API glitches, the bot should automatically re-attempt or adjust.

## 📈 STRATEGIC SUGGESTIONS

### 5. Multi-Strategy Portfolio Manager
**Suggestion:** Centrally manage risk across multiple symbols and strategies to ensure no single asset exceeds X% of total equity.

### 6. Asymmetric Grid Logic
**Suggestion:** Implement more buy levels below price and fewer sells above. Ideal for long-term accumulation of an asset.
