# CryptoBot TODO List
-------------------------------
do not delete this section.
 get allerts to telegram if bot is stopped due to ban and no error sent for the ban error also.
 state for spot bot and backtest do not hold for 
Updated: 2026-01-27
- [x] **Fix Paper Trading & Backtesting Status/Visibility (CRITICAL)**
    - Fixed "$---" market price display by ensuring `last_price` updates in all modes.
    - Resolved filtering in `App.js` to show Paper Trading bots in the Spot Bot tab.
    - Added mode badges (LIVE/PAPER/SIM) to Dashboard for visual clarity.
    - Fixed "not finding entry" bug by correcting Volume Confirmation logic.
    - Enabled Strategy Rejection Logs to show why trades are skipped in UI.
- [x] **Fix Spot Bot "Stopped" Status Discrepancy (CRITICAL)**
    - Fixed `NaN` (Not a Number) values in API response causing JSON parsing failures.
    - Implemented recursive JSON parsing in Frontend as a failsafe.
    - Standardized API status strings ("running"/"stopped").
- [x] **Add "Active Grid Matrix" to Dashboard**
    - Displays real-time Open Buy/Sell orders with price/qty for Grid Bots.
- [x] **Fix Bot Crash in Heartbeat Log**
    - Fixed `UnboundLocalError` related to `sl_price`.
    - Added `Value ($)` column to Control Panel Trade Journal table.
    - Shows Cost Basis (`entry_value`) for Sells to indicate original investment size.

- [x] **Fix duplicate/ghost bot appearing on start**
    - Updated ControlPanel to use correct `bot_key` (e.g. `live_ETHUSDT`) for selection ID.

- [x] **Improve Network Resilience (Grid Bot & Spot Bot)**
    - Added retry logic to `get_current_price` in Grid Bot to handle `NameResolutionError` and timeouts.
    - Throttled error logs for network issues to prevent spam.
    - **Added Critical Kill Switch for IP Bans (Error -1003)**: Bots will auto-stop and Server will pause polling to prevent extending bans.
    - **Parse Ban Duration**: Bot detects `until <timestamp>` in ban message and displays "Ban Lifted At: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" in logs/alerts.
    - **Detailed Waiting Status**: Spot Bot now displays exact strategy rejection reason (e.g. "RSI too high: 45 > 30") instead of generic "Waiting...".


## 🔵 TESTING & VERIFICATION

## 🔮 FUTURE ROADMAP (Moved from Improvements)
- [ ] **Asymmetric Grid**: More buy levels below, fewer sells (Accumulation Mode).
- [ ] **Command Interface**: Control bots via Telegram commands (/status, /stop, /sell).
- [ ] **Max Position Size**: Enforce absolute max $ risk per trade (e.g. max $500).
- [ ] **Correlation Check**: Alert if Grid + Spot bots are concentrated in the same direction.
- [ ] **Monte Carlo Backtest**: Randomized slippage/delay simulations to find "edge".
- [ ] **Multi-Strategy Portfolio Manager**: Centrally manage risk across total equity.

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION
- `modules/indicators.py` - Fixed ATR Calculation
- `modules/trading_bot.py` - Atomic save_state, removed inline import
- `modules/server.py` - Fixed bug in metrics
- `botfrontend/src/` - Refactored API_BASE to config.js
- `botfrontend/src/components/*.js` - Updated for config.js
- `FIXES.md` - Updated

## ✅ COMPLETED

### High Priority

    - Ensure Test bots don't appear on Live Dashboard.
    - Ensure Backtest Panel correctly identifies bots.
    - (The "second instance" issue should be resolved by correct ID-based lookups implemented in previous session and verified here).
